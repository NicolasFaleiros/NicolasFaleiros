### Hi there 👋

# Introducing Myself 🙋‍♂️

I'm Nicolas, a self-taught Data Analyst, and Data Science enthusiast from :brazil: Brazil. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics Applied to Business from the University of São Paulo. I love exploring data to discover insightful information and I am excited and eager to participate in the rapidly developing ML and AI fields. My interest in data came up in college due to some statistical/econometrics related courses and I have been teaching myself Python, R, SQL, and Tableau ever since.
